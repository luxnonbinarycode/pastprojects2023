# past projects

Here are my past projects that I have done for classes. Descriptions are below.

DATA STRUCTURES ASSIGNMENTS ARE BASED ON EXERCISES FROM OBJECT-ORIENTED DATA STRUCTURES USING JAVA FOURTH EDITION BY NELL DALE, PhD, DANIEL T. JOYCE, AND CHIP WEEMS. SOME PROGRAMS IN THE REPOSITORY COME FROM THIS BOOK AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE USED AS FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDENTS TO ANSWER EXERCISE QUESTIONS.

DATA STRUCTURES ASSIGNMENTS:

A. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW1 is a folder. Within that folder is:

1. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW1_Q1 - This Java program folder contains a program that replicates 3 shopping bags. The first 2 bags hold predefined values to determine costs which factors in the number of items, costs of each item, and a constant tax rate of 6%. The program then asks the user to fill up their own bag and the user receives a total price, including tax. The program asks the user how many items are in their bag, the costs of each item, and the number and per item cost of additional items to get the full cost of their bag, including tax.

2. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW1_Q2 - This Java program folder contains 3 packages that each hold 2 programs. PackagePartA contains 2 programs that help build up a polynomial. PackagePartB takes command line inputs and creates polynomials and calculates answers with entered values. PackagePartC calculates definite integrals.

B. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW2 is a folder. Within that folder is:

1. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW2_Q1 - This Java program folder contains programs that print the sum, amount of numbers, and the average for Tracker 1 and prints only the average for Tracker 2. Tracker 1 gets user input for summary information and Tracker 2 shows only the average from receiving user input.

2. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW2_Q2 - This Java program folder contains programs that print pairs of different data types.

C. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW4 is a folder. Within that folder is:

1. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW4_Q1 - This Java program folder contains programs of various classes that focus on collections, linked collections, linked list nodes, and sorted array collections. The programs also feature drivers that test different scenarios.

2. MaShayla_Kendrick_HW4_Q2 - This Java program folder contains programs that focus on lists, collections, iteration, and tests.

ADVANCED WEB DESIGN ASSIGNMENTS:

A. (UPDATED) DOM Modification Assignment MaShayla Kendrick - This assignment deals with manipulating the DOM to change the background color according to different time intervals.

B. FINAL PROJECT FOLDER MASHAYLA KENDRICK - This is my final project for Advanced Web Design in which I did a website for a local theater. I did not do anything with the website beyond submitting it for my final. I reused aspects from an existing website to recreate the website for my assignment. The link to the existing website is https://www.rylander.org/.

Capstone - MaShayla Kendrick, Sahil Patel, and Feifei Xie:

These are the files included in the Project Handoff for my Capstone project. I was the frontend developer, Sahil Patel, a classmate, was the backend developer, and Feifei Xie did more support work for the frontend and backend. Please unzip and follow the setup instructions for use of this AI plant care assistant, Verdure AI. 

Capstone Setup Intsructions:

These are the setup instructions for the Capstone project titled Verdure AI.
